Google Fiber Predictions
=================

Made by Eli Cooper for Georgia Tech's LMC 3705 Information Design class. 

This was my final project and covered the topic of Google Fiber, specifically how their recent (as of April 23, 2014) expansion plans might benefit the cities listed.
These cities include Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Portland, Raleigh-Durham, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, and San Jose.
