      <div class="chart area-charts"></div>
      <p class="subtext description">
        These charts show us the average download (Mbps) of internet in <span>Kansas City</span> as well as <span>Atlanta, Nashville, 
        Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham*, San Antonio, Salt Lake City, Portland, and San Jose</span> for the past twenty (20) months. 
        Google Fiber began the process of connecting homes to their network in Kansas City on 
        <a href="http://googlefiberblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/google-fiber-installations-kick-off.html" target="_blank">Nov. 13, 2012</a> 
        and shortly after, the city experienced a steady increase in average internet speeds. With Google's 
        <a href="https://fiber.google.com/newcities/" target="_blank">latest announcement</a> of other cities as potential expansion areas, 
        these graphs give us an idea of how these municipalities might benefit as a whole.

        <span class="subtext description note">* Raleigh-Durham is the average speed of both Raleigh, NC and Durham, NC for the given month</span>

      <div class="chart bar-chart"></div>
      <p class="subtext description">
        This chart shows us the percent of increase in internet speed for each of the previous cities over the same time period. While each city has had a decent increase
        since the initial month of June 2012, <span>Kansas City has clearly had a drastic improvement due to Google Fiber</span>. After breaking this larger increase into smaller bits,
        we can see how to use this data to predict the impact Google Fiber would have if the other cities were brought into the fold.
        <br/>
        <span class="subtext description note">
          &dagger; Percent of increase as compared to Jun '12 and the combined average of Dec '13 - Feb '14 to account for the recent variability of speed in Kansas City

      <div class="chart kconly-bar-chart"></div>
      <p class="subtext description">
        This chart further breaks down the improvement <span>Kansas City</span> has seen in internet download speeds into three, six, and twelve month intervals. Underestandably, the increase has
        grown with the passage of time, but <span>even the three month percentage increase for Kansas City following Google Fiber availability is substantial when compared to the 
        improvement other cities have seen with twenty months.</span> Using this information, we can finally make a prediction about how internet might improve over the same period of 
        time for the other cities on the list.

      <div class="chart prediction-chart"></div>
      <p class="subtext description">
        This chart applies the data gathered from Kansas City's increase and applies it to the other cities in the list. <span>Here, we see what the avg. download speed currently is for Feb. '14 
        and what it might look like after a 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month time interval.</span> It's hard to say how precise this mapping would be, but it offers an intrigueing glimpse at the 
        future according to what we already know.
